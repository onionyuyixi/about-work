2 Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector
    The CMS collector attempts to reduce pause times due to major collections by using separate garbage collector threads
    to trace the reachable objects concurrently with the execution of the application threads. During each major collection cycle,
    the CMS collector pauses all the application threads for a brief period at the beginning of the collection and
    again toward the middle of the collection. The second pause tends to be the longer of the two pauses.
    Multiple threads are used to do the collection work during both pauses. The remainder of the collection
    (including most of the tracing of live objects and sweeping of unreachable objects is done with one or
    more garbage collector threads that run concurrently with the application. Minor collections can
    interleave with an ongoing major cycle, and are done in a manner similar to the parallel collector
    (in particular, the application threads are stopped during minor collections).
